## Cat Plushy

Do you end up missing your cat when you're away at college? Of course you do. Even if you don't, everyone wants some extra
company in their dorm. This is a (low maintenance) cat plushy that reacts to a handwarmer. When the temperature 
outside is below 80 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature of the hand warmer is above 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit, the plushy's eyes will light up and the song "Keyboard Cat" will play. 
Originally, I was going to make this plushy for cats to cuddle with for warmth, but my objective altered when I realized how 
much I missed all the shelter cats I took care of back at home.

## Materials List

2 LilyPad LEDs

## 3 Tips
1. Outline the steps of sewing the plushy and make sure the order makes sense.
2. Use a hot glue gun to seal the conductive thread into place, but understand that if a really hot thing is placed against the
plushy, THE GLUE WILL MELT. To resolve this, use a hand warmer that doesn't heat up as much.
3. Create a design for the plushy and make it clothing so that it looks presentable in your dorm.
