![Analog Arrays](http://rachelbuccalo.github.io/img/analogarrays.png)

This project was to create a program that utilizes an array and pins 6, 7, and 8 to show random behavior of LEDs. This includes turning a random LED on at a random brightness.

One hint I'd give is that, in defining the random brightness levels, you can simplify (0, 256) to (256) because it's insinuated that 0 is the lowest brightness.
