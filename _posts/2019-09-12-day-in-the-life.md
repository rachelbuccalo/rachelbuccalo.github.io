This is a brief recount of my day on **Thursday, September 12th.**

## Start of the day

I was excited to start my day! I got an apple and a french vanilla cappuccino from Mission Dining Hall. Unfortunately, I spilled some of my drink on my hand, and wasn't able to finish my apple before class. Nonetheless, my electronic textiles course(_my favorite class_) was exhilerating and my discrete math course didn't fail to confuse me. Afterwards, I had lunch with my friends and stayed in my dorm for a bit.

## Going out!

Every weekday, I go out and play ultimate frisbee. I've been playing ever since I got here, and I really enjoy it. Since it rained that day, not many people showed up, but it was still fun. My shoes were wet and covered in grass and dirt. I ran directly from frisbee to the field house, where I played softball with Williams' team for an hour. 

### Notification

**Note:** Though I am short, **I can play ultimate frisbee.**

## Getting home

As I was walking down the hill to get back to my dorm, I look down and see a _humongous_ catipillar on the ground! I didn't want it to be stepped on, so I picked it up with two leaves and carried it to a nearby grassy area.

## Exhaustion!

After my catipillar rescue, I was exhausted! As soon as I got home, I jumped into bed, wrote this post, and fell asleep!
