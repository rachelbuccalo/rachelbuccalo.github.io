This project was to illustrate firefly (or lightening bug) flash patterns with LEDs using Arduino software, but this time, simultaneously. 
This lights up 3 different LEDs with 3 distinct patterns.
One tip I would give to others attempting this project is to understand what code can be replicated between the LEDs and what code shouldn't be.
