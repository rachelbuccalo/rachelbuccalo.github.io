* I accidentally forgot to take photos of the alligator prototyping stage of my plushy so I tried to compensate by connecting the electronic components with alligator clips while they were attached to the plushy.

This assignment was to create a plushy with 3 LED lights that are interconnected via circuitry, including a button and a switch.
I had to sew electronic components onto felt with conductive thread and create the actual toy with non-conductive thread. 

Before starting, make sure your prototype as well as all of your electronic components work.
