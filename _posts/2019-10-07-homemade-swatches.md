My project contains LEDs that light up the two i's in my embroidered "Williams". I used alligator clips to prototype my design, then implemented it on fabric using conductive thread, conductive fabric, a battery, and LEDs.

One tip I would give to others attempting this project is to plan out your space on fabric before you commit(i.e. where each electronic component will go).
