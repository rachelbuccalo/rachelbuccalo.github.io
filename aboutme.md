subtitle: Why I'm taking electronic textiles
---

My name is Rachel Buccalo. I’m a creator with a heavy background in visual art, which for me means that I’m attracted to tangible ideas. I love seeing my thought process on a canvas or sketchbook, and I want to broaden how I choose to convey a message or construct a project. Electronic textiles is a perfect bridge between the somewhat abstract mathematic portion of coding and the visual portion of object-building.
